# WET2.0
The 2020 Spring Great Lakes Water Resources II adapted the Wetland Extent Tool (WET) to create WET 2.0, which is a tool with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that automates wetland classification for the entire Great Lakes Basin using Sentinel-1 C-SAR, Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE).
